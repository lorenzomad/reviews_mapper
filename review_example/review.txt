Bought pretty much on impulse. Needed a basic laptop as the Acer Spin5 I use has a power connection glitch. This machine did come with Windows 11 installed, but I just finished going through all the updates (about 6 or so) to get to the latest version of Windows 11, and it runs ok. Also went through a dozen driver updates and everything works ok. I was concerned about 8 megs of RAM being enough for the software I use, and it's not, apparently, as that software runs but crashes after a while. Also, 256 GB of ssd storage is not enough. However, both those things are pretty easy to upgrade. Screen optical quality is very lackluster & I have been trying to tweak that in Windows with not much luck. I like the touch screen, track pad, keyboard feel. I like the power connector, seems sturdy and that's important to me, as I have regularly killed laptop power connections. All in all, a pretty good deal for $385 + tax.
